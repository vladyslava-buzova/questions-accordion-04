2. Set up the questions array as a state variable using the useState hook.
3. Iterate over the questions array and render a SingleQuestion component for each item in the array.
4. In the SingleQuestion component, displayed the question text in the header and a button to toggle the question text.
5. Defined a function that toggles the state of a "showAnswer" flag, which determines whether the answer text is displayed or not.
